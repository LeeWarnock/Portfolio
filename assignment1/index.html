			<p>That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. They were just sucked into space. I'll alert the crew. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.</p>

			<p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. This should be interesting. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. How long can two people talk about nothing? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Talk about going nowhere fast.</p>
